Auto Lamp

A script that controls the light depending on the time of day. Made for xiaomi lamps.

During development, I encountered a problem on the lamp side. The problem is described by me here:

Installation:
1. Download a project
2. pip install yeelight
3. py main.pyw

I have added a .bat file whose shortcut needs to be added to the task scheduler. It automatically distributes the Internet from the PC that the lamp uses
